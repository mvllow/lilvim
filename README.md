# lilvim

> A modular and opinionated starting point for Neovim

## Features

- 🪴 Self-contained modules
- 📦 Documented built-in functionality
- 🥟 Deliciously simple to extend

## Usage

When installed via a package manager, all modules can be required:

```lua
vim.pack.add({
	"https://github.com/mvllow/lilvim"
})
require('lil-<module>')
```

Each module is self-contained and can be individually copied to your own
configuration. Prefer the `plugin/` directory for automatic loading or the
`lua/` directory for more control.

## Principles

> Heavily inspired by [Rational Emacs](https://github.com/SystemCrafters/rational-emacs)

### Minimal and modular by design

Lilvim includes several self-contained modules which handle their own vim options, keymaps and configurations. This approach differs from the common practice of separating functionality by plugin.

### Prioritise built-in Neovim functionality

We demonstrate Neovim's built-in capabilities and lower the platform's barrier to entry for new users. This lightweight approach encourages users to first understand the platform's features before adding plugins.

### Idiomatic loading

Neovim's `plugin` directory automatically loads all modules on startup. Each module is self-contained and can be copied individually.
